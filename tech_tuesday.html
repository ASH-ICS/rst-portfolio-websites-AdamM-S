      <td>
The new iphone 15 pro max has come out recently.  It has various different features that have been added from the iphone 14.  The iphone 15 pro max is very similar to the old iphone 14 but the iphone 15 pro max is better quality, with a variety of features. The phone is a little pricey, it starts at $1,749 canadian and only gets more expensive.  The new iphone 15 pro max has changed from the original material of aluminum to titanium which is a lot stronger than the old materials if used correctly.

What is so good about the quality and what new features come with the new iphone 15 pro max.  The new phone has an upgrade in the camera by having an upgrade from 3x zoom to 5x optical zoom which is a massive jump from the iphone 14.  The iPhone 15 max zoom can go up to 25x zoom.  Performance on iphones have never been much of a problem but apple has still decided to one up the iphone 14. The iphone 14 pro mac now uses an A17 pro chip, It is similar to last year's A16 pro chip using 6 CPU cores and 16 core neural engine. The iPhone now has a six core GPU, this upgrade helps the iPhone perform 2 times more operations per second from 17 trillion to 35 trillion. The RAM has also been upgraded from 6GB to 8GB. This new A17 chip is the first to be built on a 3nm design. All this to say that the new iPhone 15 is incredibly fast and can run very high processing speeds with great performance. Display on the iPhone 15 is also great. You will be able to get a 2796 x 1290 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Brightness levels are very similar except the brightness increases when you are outside. The iPhone 15 still has the dynamic island but many still think that it does not do as much as it is capable so people prefer the new action button. Battery life has not made too much of an upgrade from the iPhone 15 as Apple promised although they did make a switch from the lightning cable to the USB-C. Charging is not as quick as many other smartphones but this is not the largest downside of the new phone as the battery is still incredible to those who do not spend their entire day on their smartphone.

With the release of the iphone 15 pro max it has released a new ios update which has brought a variety of features to the iphone 8 to the newer phones.  The ios update allows iPhone users to be able to design their widgets to have interactive elements, so you can tap on a widget and have it do something right from your home screen.  The new iphone 15 pro max has removed the old ring and silent button with a new action button that is customizable.  With the new iphone 15 pro max action button you can do a variety of things such as: turn on a Focus mode, open the Camera app, turn on the

  <td>Artificial Intelligence is the Future</td>
  <td>Artificial intelligence is one of the brand new changes we have made in 2023, artificial intelligence has just begun to expand and become recognized worldwide. Artificial intelligence can do a variety of different things such as beating humans at complicated games, and answering complex questions. Artificial intelligence has many capabilities that us humans have to adapt to and learn from. AI can be used to learn from and employees need to gather skills that they know and are good at making sure that AI does not take their job. Although AI seems to be the future, humans are still capable of doing more and other skills that we must maintain rather than letting AI take over our jobs.

There are many negatives of using artificial intelligence but this new form of learning can also help us in positive ways. Artificial intelligence can be used to teach people new things and perform set tasks at very high speeds. Humans can choose to use AI negatively or positively.

Artificial intelligence can see almost every outcome of a complicated game which will make them have a much higher chance in beating a human.  In a few games that they have beaten humans are chess and go, which are 2 very complex games that take a lot of brain power to play because you have to think ahead of your opponent.  With artificial intelligence being able to think outside the box, they can also answer complex questions, with a programmed artificial intelligence called chatGPT.  This A.I. can answer complex questions in just a few seconds, with highly detailed responses.

AI will continue to develop but we have to decide whether we use it in a positive or negative way. AI has the potential to be the future and a device us humans can use to advance the way we live our lives. We just have to use it in the proper ways.

    <td>Blockchains in the modern world</td>
    <td>A blockchain is a database that is spread on computer networks. They are most commonly known for their important role in cryptocurrency. Block chains are able to maintain secure and decentralized records of transactions. Blockchains are not only limited to cryptocurrencies but they can also be used to make data in any industry unable to be altered. Not all blockchains are completely impenetrable, they can be exploited through coding. Hackers are able to run nodes on blockchains if they want to alter the blockchain and steal cryptocurrency. All they have to do is convince the other nodes that their copy is valid. The hacker needs to control the majority of the network and insert it at the exact moment. This is known as the 51% attack because you need to control more than 50% of a network to attempt it.

Blockchains were introduced in 1991, to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.  It was not until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.  Blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.  

	All in all, blockchains are well known in today's day, they are a pretty secure system that has been made through the past two decades.  Blockchains are primarily used for cryptocurrency, since it has become very popular in recent years.  Blockchains can be exploited, but not all of them, most of them are very hard to hack into.

      <td>Elon Mush Creating an AI company</td>
      <td>
	Elon Musk, who has been talking about artificial intelligence lately, seems to be planning something AI related.  Elon Musk has found a new artificial intelligence company called X.AI.corp.  The multi-company executive is known to have a special liking for the letter X and has even recently renamed Twitter, Inc. as X Corp, he also included in the new Ai.corp name.  


Musk has put pauses in his development of artificial intelligence after seeing that chat GPT may have been politically biased, this is not confirmed. Elon also has the worry of training AI to be woke because of the dangers associated with creating AI. His goal is to create AI that is truth seeking. Musk has also been hiring Deepmind researchers including some scientists, It is believed that they are working together on a new project with X corp. Recently Elon has purchased 10,000 GPU’s for AI development at X corp.

The future of X corp is bright and Elon is a very bright person, who knows what he may be able to do with the future of AI. There are many things that can be accomplished with X corp and with Elon and artificial intelligence, the future is hopeful.

        <td>Blockchains</td>
        <td>Blockchains tend to actually be a lot more than just a secure way of transferring data. Blockchains come in many different forms. Bitcoin is probably the most popular blockchain cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is not the best form for transactions though, not everywhere accepts crypto currency. The only way cryptocurrency users were able to send funds was through digital wallet addresses. Each transaction gets recorded as a “block” in the form of a sequence of numbers. This block is now confirmed across networks, while keeping some degree of anonymity across users. Cryptocurrency miners are able to earn coins by organizing these blocks, therefore making these transactions valid across networks.


Crypto currencies are meant to be used for virtual coins, and they are usually exchanged on decentralized computer networks between people with virtual wallets. These transactions are recorded publicly on distributed, tamper-proof ledgers known as blockchains. No matter how secure blockchains may seem they are never completely secure. There are new ways of crypto mining these block chains coming out everyday with new methods.

The popularity of blockchains have skyrocketed in previous years but people now understand the risk that comes along with this form of currency. Although they are not as popular, many people still use them willing to take the risk.

          <td>	ChatGPT’s open AI when first launched had millions of users, ChatGPT’s capabilities were immediately concerning. Chat GPT was able to open more potential for hackers to access cybersecurity software. There was a large increase of 38% of software breaches in 2022. From the perspective of malicious hackers, ChatGPT is a game changer. It is now important that all employees retrain cybersecurity awareness and prevention due to the rapid changes in AI. Chat GPT was able to produce malicious code if the user created the right prompt. Chat GPT was programmed and intended to not produce any malicious code or code intended for hacking. Although manipulating chatGPT was possible with enough prompts and pushing the AI further, while also being creative, hackers are able to trick the AI into generating hacking code. With the cybersecurity pros considering the potential of ChatGPT and the emerging generative AI market, checks and balances which are essential to ensure the technology does not become difficult to take care of or to carry around.  Cybersecurity leaders are retraining and equipping their employees. The gouvernement needs to take a shift in our mindset to focus more on artificial intelligence.

All in all, chatGPT is a very dangerous source which could affect cybersecurity in many bad ways and it is important to keep your cybersecurity prevention software updated and protected.  The government has to focus on developing cybersecurity to a further extent so that it does not get hacked. ChatGPT should not be viewed in a negative way although it has the capability of being manipulated which is important to fix.

            <td>The cybertruck can go 0-60 in less than 3 seconds.  It also beats a porsche 911 in a race while the cyber truck is towing the porsche 911, meaning that it is carrying extra weight and it is still beating it in a race.  If you get the perfect start, a base Corvette Z06 will outperform the Cyberbeast to 60 mph. It will also outperform the Cyber in the quarter-mile and outrun the Cybertruck more times on a single tank of gas.


The new tesla cyber truck has finally released maybe a little bit late but the wait was completely worth it. The new cyber truck is bulletproof and can take blows from hammers. Along with that it can also tow up to 11,000 pounds. The cyber truck has shatter proof glass which can keep the car as quiet as outer space on the inside. The bed of the cyber truck is 6’5 feet top to bottom and just under 5 feet side to side. This means you have an extreme amount of storage in the bed of the truck. Not only would this truck be amazing for camping and utility but this truck is extremely fast and could be used as an everyday car. In conclusion the tesla cyber truck will run us approximately 81,500 dollars canadian, it seems like a worthy purchase although would you buy this over your typical ford truck.

            <tr>Renewable energy is the key to helping fix climate change. In today’s world climate change affects many people and places around the world. In order to help fix climate change fossil fuels need to be reduced by 50% by the year 2030 and need to be completely reduced by the year 2050. A renewable energy source is something that has the ability to be restored by nature. Approximately 80% of all countries around the world are dependent on fossil fuels. That means nearly 6-7 billion people are relying on fossil fuels. When we make the change to fixing climate change which is already underway. Our world will not only be healthier but it will also open up job opportunities to keep sustainable communities all around the world. Every dollar that gets invested into renewable energy investments opens up three times more job opportunities than fossil fuel industries. Renewable energy is healthier to the human body too, our air is being polluted by fossil fuels and nearly 13 million deaths a year are due to environmental causes.


We can create energy from the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat which are all easily accessible things that are found on earth.  The world just has to wait for them to come around so that we can create energy.  There are multiple reasons that renewable energy is important for today, like how renewable energy is all around us, it's cheaper, it's healthier for our environment, and it makes more economical sense for everyone to be able to afford it.

            <td>Digital weights are a new revolutionary way to work out in different ways. The newest form of digital weights are called Tonal. The digital weights are programmed to help you gain strength by using mechanical resistance and determining based on how hard you pull the weight will either increase or decrease based on how much resistance you pull. The system uses electromagnetic technology in order to deliver up to 200 pounds of resistance. When you begin tonal it does a calibration in order to determine your base strength, speed, acceleration and range of motion .etc. When you lift weights in the gym you have to gauge the amount of weight you use for each different workout, tonal is able to help you determine how much weight you can actually lift for as many reps as you can with a reasonable weight. It does this by dividing your maximum effort into a weight that is possible based on your max for a total set. Tonal is able to do this by just calculating how much resistance you can pull.

The adaptive weight system performs thousands of calculations per second, while also monitoring your form which changes the resistance that is put on the weight.  This relies on an electromagnetic motor that creates resistance, unlike traditional metal weights that use gravity to create resistance.  With this machine, it will be harder than the traditional one with weights because the weight is constant the entire time, and it doesn't change at all throughout the entire time.  The smart flex tracks your workout and changes it throughout the entire workout so that you can become a lot stronger  faster, since it makes it what is the best for you.

The new tonal technology for lifting weights is revolutionary for anyone who just wants to buy one piece of technology that could help you do a number of workouts, this new technology is not only better at saving space although it is also a safer alternative to lifting real weights.
